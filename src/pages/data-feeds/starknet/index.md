StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup operating as an L2 network over Ethereum.

Chainlink Data Feeds are available on the StarkNet testnet as Cairo smart contracts.

For a complete list of Chainlink Price Feeds available on StarkNet testnet, see the [Price Feed Contract Addresses](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=starknet) page.
